If you are a beginner willing to learn more about Python. This is the code for getting started with.

It covers concept of variables, loops, conditionals, lists and dictionaries in python

This program is solution to the problem in book, 'Automating boring stuffs with python'

You can call it FANTANSY GAME INVENTORY 

So, fist what are we building??

1. You are provided with a dictionary value in which keys are string values which 
    refers to item and value refers to number of items, in this program it is represented
    by 'inv'
2. Also, you have list 'dragonLoot' and you need to add items in this list to the 
   dictionary and finally compute the total number of items you have in the inventory

3. So, basically you write two function for that,
    
         a. addToInventory(inv, dragonLoot):  #line 2
    
         b. displayInventory(inventory):      #line 23

4. addInventory is by, "inv=addToInventory(inv, dragonLoot)" part of the code

5. Just go through these functions and try to understand how it works, it is pretty 
    simple and I guess you won't have any problem
